If you wish to deploy this website yourself locally from my provided new-Chrono-Ark folder, then please do the following

1) Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can check the installed versions by running the following commands in your terminal:

  node --version
  npm --version

If Node.js and npm are not installed, please visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.

2) Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory containing the Vite React app.

3) Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

  npm install

This command will install all the necessary packages and dependencies required for the project based on the package.json file.

4) Once the installation is complete, you can build the production-ready version of your Vite React app by running the following command:

  npm run build

This command will generate an optimized and minified build of your app in the dist directory (or the directory specified in your Vite configuration).

5) After the build process is finished, you can preview the production build locally using the npx vite preview command:

  npx vite preview

This command will start a local server and serve the production build of your app.

6) Once the preview server is running, you will see output similar to the following in your terminal:

  > Local: http://localhost:5000
  > Network: use --host to expose

The output indicates that your app is being served locally at http://localhost:5000 (or a different port if specified).

7) Open your web browser and visit the provided local URL (http://localhost:5000) to see your Vite React app running in preview mode.
You should now be able to interact with your app and see it functioning as expected.

8) To stop the preview server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the server is running.
